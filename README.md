# DISCOVER MBA Flask App
DISCOVER MBA is a recommendation tool for people interested in applying to full-time Master of Business Administration(MBA) programs offered by business schools in the US and abroad. Recommendations are based on user-based collaborative filtering methods comparing education and professional backgrounds of prospective applicants and a database of professionals with MBA degrees.

Prospective applicants can upload their LinkedIn profile in pdf format to the web app and the app will process the profile with Natural Language Processing packages and compare the incoming profile to a reference LinkedIn profile database.  Result will be a list of business schools based on profile similarity of the applicants to those in the reference database.

Project is deployed on AWS at http://54.190.48.226:5000/
